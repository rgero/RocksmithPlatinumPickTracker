# Rocksmith Platinum Pick Tracker
In 2019, I kept track of all of the platinum picks in the game Rocksmith 2014 in a Google Spreadsheet. There were a couple pieces of data that were important to me. They were the following

- The Artist
- The Song Name
- The date that the pick was achieved
- The Path (whether it was Lead, Rhythm, or Bass)
- The Difficulty (Typically I focused on Hard or Master)
- The Accuracy

Over the course of the year, I obtained over 280 picks. Knowing that there are over 1500 songs in the game, and each one has at least two paths and four difficulties for each path, continuing to track off this in a spreadsheet would be rather tedious. Additionally, what if I went back to the same song and improved my accuracy.

The goal of this project is to manage this data more effectively.



## Current State of the project (Jan 2020)
  - I have the ability to create a new song
  - I have the ability to edit a song
  - I have the ability to view the entire of songs stored
  - Everything is hooked up with firebase.
